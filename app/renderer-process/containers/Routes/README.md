Routes
======
The routes holds all the routes that we can route to. It wraps all of our views in a `Layout` component, and gives us the ability to switch between them with ease.

How to use
----------
```js
import Routes from "app/containers/Routes";

<Router history={browserHistory}>{Routes}</Router>
```
