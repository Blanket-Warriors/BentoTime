Actions
-------

Actions are the minimal representation of changes that can happen to our state.

## How to Use
	The only requirement for an action is that it has a type property that is not undefined.  We use all caps to represent the names of these actions as a naming convention of these constants.  All of the actions are described in `ActionTypes` except for the actions given to us by redux-react-router.
