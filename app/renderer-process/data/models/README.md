Models
======
Our models help us define our common definitions of [Libraries](./Library), [Books](./Book), and [Chapters](./Chapter), so that regardless of the API we ping, we can still treat all of these the same way in BentoTime.

Additionally, models give our data structures additional functionality (namely custom merge methods). This helps us keep our [reducers](../reducers) very clear in their objectives.
