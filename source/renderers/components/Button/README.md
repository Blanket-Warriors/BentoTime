Button
======
Currently a Button component is just a button element and lets us apply styles in this directory.  However, this gives us the option of further extending Buttons in the future without changing our pre-existing code.

How to use
-----------
```js
import Button from "app/components/Button";

<Button />
```

#### Props
* All props are passed through to the resulting Button

#### ClassNames
 * `.button`: Our main class
