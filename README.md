# BentoTime
BentoTime is a pc/mac/linux app for reading and saving manga. We created this project in hopes that it could be an easy way to read manga, as well as serve as a resource for learning to code with [React](./documentation/Dependencies.md#react) and [Electron](./documentation/Dependencies.md#electron-prebuilt). Expect clean code, impeccable documentation, and descriptive tests. Also, feel free to contribute if you would think you could help us with this goal!

## Using BentoTime
If you just want to use BentoTime without entering a single line of code, just download the [newest release](https://github.com/Blanket-Warriors/BentoTime/releases), and get started!

## Getting Started With Development
  1. install dependencies - `npm install`
  2. Make sure all the tests are running - `npm test`
  3. Run Webpack dev server and electron - `npm start`
