Stubs
===========

As opposed to fixtures, which focus on data, Stubs should focus on fake functions. These are useful in that they let us focus on the features of a specific file, while stubbing out its dependencies. The files in this folder should focus on commonly stubbed functions, as we can use Sinon to stub out more test-by-test specific functions and methods.
